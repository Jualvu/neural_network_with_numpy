# neural_network_with_numpy
Neural Network developed from scratch using numpy and trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize digits from 0-9

Structured in a object-oriented or class-based code. Not too modular but good enough to understand

This is a personal project to familiarize myself with Neural Networks and specially the back propagation process
